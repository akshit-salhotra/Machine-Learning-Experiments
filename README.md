# Machine Learning Coursework â€“ CS303

This repository contains assignments and experiments completed as part of my **Machine Learning (CS303)** course during my Bachelor's program.

## Overview

The repository currently holds **three completed experiments**, each in its own folder:

1. **Exp 1 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Performed detailed EDA on a given dataset.
2. **Exp 2 â€“ Linear Regression**  
   - Implemented and evaluated linear regression on a dataset.
3. **Exp 3 â€“ Logistic Regression**  
   - Built and analyzed a logistic regression model.

More experiments will be added as the course progresses.

##  Repository Structure

Each experiment is organized as follows:

```
Exp X/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset.csv           # Dataset used for the experiment
â”œâ”€â”€ experiment.ipynb      # Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis
â””â”€â”€ Images/               # Folder containing relevant images/plots
```

Where `X` is the experiment number (1, 2, 3, â€¦).

Example:

```
Exp 1/
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ eda.ipynb
â””â”€â”€ Images/

Exp 2/
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ linear_regression.ipynb
â””â”€â”€ Images/

Exp 3/
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ logistic_regression.ipynb
â””â”€â”€ Images/
```

##  Current Status

- âœ… **Exp 1 â€“ EDA**
- âœ… **Exp 2 â€“ Linear Regression**
- âœ… **Exp 3 â€“ Logistic Regression**
- ðŸ”„ More experiments coming soonâ€¦

##  Notes

- All datasets used are stored as `.csv` files in their respective experiment folders.
- The `Images/` folder within each experiment contains plots, graphs, and other visual outputs generated during analysis.
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) include both the code and explanations.

Feel free to explore each experiment folder to see the code, results, and visualizations.
